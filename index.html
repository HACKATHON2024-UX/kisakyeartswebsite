          Kizito Ronald Kisakye, alias "Kisakye Arts," emerges as a profound and relevant creative with an insightful, captivating sense of art portrayed in his different intriguing artworks based in his fatherland, Kampala, Uganda. The burgeoning artist objects his talent in relation to his first name, "Ronald," meaning "Love for nature," objecting crude ruminative ideas across multiple disciplines such as painting, drawing, and photography. Through this meditative creation, Kisakye has carved a cathartic state captivating audiences accrue to his artistry.
          
          The "Ronald" factor affirms a blood flow of art in him, that is, art is a skill born this leads to the painterly taste of his brushstrokes. Due to that amazing trait, he creates subtle works and realism borrowing inspirations from nature and prominent artists such as Alain Pontecorvo, James McNeill Whistler, Picasso, and others.
